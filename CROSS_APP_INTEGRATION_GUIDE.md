# Cross-App Integration Guide

## Overview

This document describes the integration between the Student Bus Tracking Application and the Supervisor/Driver applications. The integration enables real-time communication, data synchronization, and cross-app notifications between all three applications.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CrossAppIntegrationService** - Handles message sending and receiving between apps
2. **RealTimeSyncService** - Manages real-time data synchronization
3. **CrossAppNotificationService** - Handles cross-app notifications
4. **CrossAppMessage** - Data model for inter-app communication
5. **Driver & Supervisor Models** - Data models for driver and supervisor information

### Data Flow

```
Student App ←→ Firebase Firestore ←→ Driver App
     ↓                                    ↓
Supervisor App ←→ Firebase Firestore ←→ Supervisor App
```

## Firebase Collections

### New Collections Added

- `drivers` - Driver information and status
- `supervisors` - Supervisor information and assignments
- `cross_app_messages` - Inter-app communication messages

### Message Types

- `location_update` - Bus location updates
- `checkin` - Student check-in notifications
- `emergency` - Emergency alerts
- `notification` - General notifications
- `status_update` - Status changes
- `attendance` - Attendance records

## Integration Features

### 1. Real-Time Location Sharing

**Student App → Driver/Supervisor Apps**
- Students' location updates are automatically sent to assigned drivers and supervisors
- Location data includes coordinates, speed, direction, and timestamp
- Updates sent every 10 seconds when bus is moving

**Driver App → Student/Supervisor Apps**
- Bus location updates are shared with students and supervisors
- Real-time tracking of bus position on routes

### 2. Check-in Notifications

**Student App → Driver/Supervisor Apps**
- Automatic notifications when students check in/out
- Includes check-in type (GPS, QR, Manual)
- Location verification and timestamp

### 3. Emergency Alerts

**Any App → All Relevant Apps**
- Emergency alerts are broadcast to all relevant parties
- High-priority notifications with sound and vibration
- Automatic location sharing during emergencies

### 4. Cross-App Messaging

**Bidirectional Communication**
- Drivers can send messages to students and supervisors
- Supervisors can communicate with drivers and students
- Students can send emergency alerts to drivers and supervisors

## Implementation Details

### Student App Integration

#### 1. Authentication Integration
```java
// Start cross-app integration after login
authService.startCrossAppIntegration();
```

#### 2. Location Updates
```java
// Send location update to driver and supervisor
crossAppService.sendLocationUpdate(
    studentId, busId, latitude, longitude, speed, direction
);
```

#### 3. Check-in Notifications
```java
// Send check-in notification
crossAppService.sendCheckInNotification(
    studentId, busId, stopId, checkInType
);
```

#### 4. Emergency Alerts
```java
// Send emergency alert
crossAppService.sendEmergencyAlert(
    studentId, busId, emergencyType, message
);
```

### Driver App Integration

#### Required Features
- Real-time bus location tracking
- Student check-in management
- Emergency alert handling
- Communication with supervisors
- Route management

#### Data Models
```java
public class Driver {
    private String driverId;
    private String name;
    private String assignedBusId;
    private String routeId;
    private boolean isOnDuty;
    // ... other fields
}
```

### Supervisor App Integration

#### Required Features
- Multi-route monitoring
- Driver management
- Student tracking
- Emergency response
- Analytics and reporting

#### Data Models
```java
public class Supervisor {
    private String supervisorId;
    private String name;
    private List<String> assignedRoutes;
    private List<String> assignedDrivers;
    // ... other fields
}
```

## Firebase Security Rules

### Cross-App Messages Collection
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /cross_app_messages/{messageId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        (resource.data.receiverId == request.auth.uid || 
         resource.data.senderId == request.auth.uid);
    }
    
    match /drivers/{driverId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == driverId;
    }
    
    match /supervisors/{supervisorId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == supervisorId;
    }
  }
}
```

## Notification Channels

### Student App
- **Cross-App Messages** - General messages from drivers/supervisors
- **Emergency Alerts** - High-priority emergency notifications
- **Location Updates** - Bus location and route updates

### Driver App
- **Student Check-ins** - Student check-in notifications
- **Emergency Alerts** - Emergency situations
- **Supervisor Messages** - Messages from supervisors

### Supervisor App
- **Driver Updates** - Driver status and location updates
- **Student Alerts** - Student-related notifications
- **Emergency Response** - Emergency alerts requiring action

## Testing the Integration

### Demo Data Setup

1. **Driver Accounts**
   - Driver ID: `driver001`
   - Password: `driver123`
   - Assigned Bus: `BUS001`

2. **Supervisor Accounts**
   - Supervisor ID: `supervisor001`
   - Password: `supervisor123`
   - Assigned Routes: `ROUTE001`, `ROUTE002`

3. **Test Scenarios**
   - Student check-in → Driver/Supervisor notification
   - Emergency alert → All relevant parties
   - Location update → Real-time tracking
   - Cross-app messaging → Bidirectional communication

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Firebase Configuration
- Ensure all apps use the same Firebase project
- Configure proper security rules
- Set up Cloud Messaging for push notifications

### 2. API Keys
- Google Maps API key shared across apps
- Firebase configuration files for each app
- Proper package name configuration

### 3. Permissions
- Location permissions for all apps
- Notification permissions
- Camera permissions for QR scanning

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Firebase Analytics Events
- `cross_app_message_sent`
- `emergency_alert_triggered`
- `location_update_sent`
- `checkin_notification_sent`

### Performance Metrics
- Message delivery success rate
- Real-time sync latency
- Notification delivery rate
- Emergency response time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Messages Not Received**
   - Check Firebase security rules
   - Verify user authentication
   - Check network connectivity

2. **Location Updates Not Syncing**
   - Verify location permissions
   - Check Firebase Firestore rules
   - Ensure proper service initialization

3. **Notifications Not Showing**
   - Check notification permissions
   - Verify notification channels
   - Check Firebase Cloud Messaging setup

### Debug Logging
Enable debug logging in all services:
```java
Log.d(TAG, "Cross-app message sent: " + messageId);
Log.d(TAG, "Location update received: " + location);
Log.d(TAG, "Emergency alert triggered: " + alertType);
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Offline Support** - Queue messages when offline
2. **Message Encryption** - Encrypt sensitive communications
3. **Advanced Analytics** - Detailed reporting and insights
4. **Multi-language Support** - Internationalization
5. **Voice Messages** - Audio communication support
6. **Video Calls** - Emergency video communication
